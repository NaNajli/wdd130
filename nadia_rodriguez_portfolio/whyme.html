        present practical work, and achieve objectives. In these projects, 
        I was able to grow in knowledge, develop organizational capacity, explore my capacity,
        and trust in my knowledge. I had the task of testing a web page, putting together
        a test plan, designing test cases, executing them, carrying out an exploratory 
        testing session, reporting improvements and defects. My most significant knowledge 
        in the area of testing is planning and monitoring; Related to agile methodologies,
        Scrum. (Jira software). I am a person with the ability to plan, detail and organize,
        which generates a favorable environment to be able to fulfill my task as a tester
        to detect errors and improve the quality of the software. I have ease and affinity 
        with technology, which helps me to be constantly interested in training and updating
        myself. At the same time, I have more than 6 years of experience in customer service, 
        and I had the opportunity to always work as a team. I know that all these skills that 
        I have are valuable for teamwork and I am willing to continue learning in order to 
        continue improving.</p>
