    During the tester course, I had the opportunity to work with a <strong>team</strong>  
    ,present practical work, and achieve objectives. These experiences allowed me to grow in knowledge, develop organizational skills,
     explore my capabilities, and gain confidence in my expertise.I had the task of <strong>testing</strong> a web page, putting together
    a test <strong>plan</strong>, designing test cases,<strong>executing </strong> them, carrying out an exploratory 
    testing session, reporting improvements and defects. My most significant knowledge 
    in the area of testing is <strong>planning and monitoring</strong>; Related to <strong>agile methodologies</strong>,
    Scrum. (Jira software). I am a person with the ability to plan, detail and organize,
    which generates a favorable environment to be able to fulfill my task as a tester
    to detect errors and improve the quality of the software. I have ease and affinity 
    with <strong>technology</strong>, which helps me to be constantly interested in <strong>training and updating</strong>
    myself. At the same time, I have more than 6 years of experience in customer service, 
    and I had the opportunity to always work as a team. I know that all these skills that 
    I have are valuable for teamwork and I am willing to continue learning in order to 
    continue <strong>improving</strong>
