    <div class ="aboutp"><p>I am a person who has learned to persevere and achieve my goals
        thanks to my efforts and the company of family and friends. I am currently a Brigham 
        Young University Pathway student. I got to know the world of programming during the
        pandemic because the place where I worked closed; Therefore, I gave guitar classes
        to children and adolescents online for that reason I started to be interested in 
        technology and used all the resources to be able to teach and motivate the children 
        that I taught for almost a year. The first course I took was HTML and CSS at 
        Codecademy. At the same time, I began to prepare myself to improve my level of 
        English and be able to study at BYU. I am currently doing my first web and computer
        programming certificate at BYU. Some Hobbies In addition to my love of technology,
        design and code I am also interested in music. I have played guitar since I have 
        sixteen years old itâ€™s an activity that I do to relax and hope later to be able
        to use my knowledge in music to contribute to technology.</p></div>
