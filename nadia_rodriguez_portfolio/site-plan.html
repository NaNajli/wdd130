        In this portfolio you can find my academic training, experiences, projects, and other hobbies that brought me here.
        Inspiration:
        I think programming is something I've been looking for for a long time. Mainly the front end allows me to combine creativity, design, and code.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        I am a person who has learned to persevere and achieve my goals thanks to my efforts and the company of family and friends.
        I am currently a Brigham Young University Pathway student. 
        I got to know the world of programming during the pandemic because the place where I worked closed; Therefore, I gave guitar classes to children and adolescents online for that reason I started to be interested in technology and used all the resources to be able to teach and motivate the children that I taught for almost a year. 
        The first course I took was HTML and CSS at Codecademy. At the same time, I began to prepare myself to improve my level of English and be able to study at BYU.
        I am currently doing my first web and computer programming certificate at BYU.
        Some Hobbies 
        In addition to my love of technology, design and code I am also interested in music. I have played guitar since I have sixteen years old it’s an activity that I do to relax and hope later to be able to use my knowledge in music to contribute to technology.

        usability, accessibility, security, performance and portability tests.
        Why me?
        During the tester course, I had the opportunity to work with a team, present practical work, 
        and achieve objectives. In these projects, I was able to grow in knowledge, 
        develop organizational capacity, explore my capacity, and trust in my knowledge.
        I had the task of testing a web page, putting together a test plan, designing test cases, executing them, 
        carrying out an exploratory testing session, reporting improvements and defects. 
        My most significant knowledge in the area of testing is planning and monitoring;
         Related to agile methodologies, Scrum. (Jira software). 
         I am a person with the ability to plan, detail and organize, 
         which generates a favorable environment to be able to fulfill my task as a tester 
         to detect errors and improve the quality of the software. I have ease and affinity with technology,
        which helps me to be constantly interested in training and updating myself. At the same time, 
        I have more than 6 years of experience in customer service, and I had the opportunity 
        to always work as a team. I know that all these skills that I have are valuable for teamwork and I 
        am willing to continue learning in order to continue improving.
