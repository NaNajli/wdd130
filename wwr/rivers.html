        <p class = "salomonp">Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river.
         The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living
          near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the 
          rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
         Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep
          are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa
           pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or 
           rain when needed.
          Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest 
          undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster,
           and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are 
           good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate 
           the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

        <p class = "canyonp">Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, 
         the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, 
         beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs
          from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding
           scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity,
            and great whitewater opportunities.
          Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
         Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the 
         uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

             You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.Grand Canyon river rafting combines
              world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river
               experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, 
               but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
             CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon 
             are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river
              variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, 
              so we often refer to both.</p>
